    "Cross correlation is a way to measure the degree of similarity between a time series and a lagged version of another time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of correlation is useful to calculate because it can tell us if the values of one time series are predictive of the future values of another time series. In other words, it can tell us if one time series is a leading indicator for another time series.\n",

    "This type of correlation is used in many different fields, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Business: Marketing spend is often considered to be a leading indicator for future revenue of businesses. For example, if a business spends an abnormally high amount of money on marketing during one quarter, then total revenue is expected to be high x quarters later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economics: The consumer confidence index (CCI) is considered to be a leading indicator for the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country. For example, if CCI is high during a given month, the GDP is likely to be higher x months later."
